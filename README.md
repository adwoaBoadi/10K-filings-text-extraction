# 10K-filings-text-extraction


This repository hosts the code designed to extract textual data from various sections of 10-K filings submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Leveraging the sec-api.io API, the script efficiently retrieves text data based on the ticker symbols of specific companies of interest. It is tailored to extract comprehensive 10-K filings data from the SEC Edgar database, facilitating in-depth analysis of corporate filings. 

The raison d'être of this repository is to offer a solution for extracting complete textual data from all sections of 10-K filings recorded in the SEC Edgar database. While the sec-api.io platform provides excellent guidance on section-specific text data extraction from 10-K filings, it stops short of a comprehensive tutorial for obtaining text from entire 10-K documents ever filed. Recognizing this gap, the code within this repository harnesses the sec-api.io API to efficiently retrieve full text data using the ticker symbols of companies, enabling a thorough analysis of their corporate filings over time. This functionality is vital for researchers and analysts who require complete dataset compilations from 10-K filings for longitudinal studies, comparative analysis, or holistic data mining endeavors.
